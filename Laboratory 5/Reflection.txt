The purpose of the SmartRoute Pro app is to solve the daily 30% inefficiency in waste collection by replacing fixed routes with dynamic, sensor-driven navigation. The target users are waste management drivers who need a clear, prioritized list of bins that actually require emptying. I chose a burgundy and cream color scheme for high readability and professional branding, with sage green symbolizing the environmental recovery of those wasted resources. A major challenge during the design process was balancing the visual hierarchy to ensure that critical data, like the 98% fill level, stood out immediately without cluttering the small mobile screen. With more time, I would improve the prototype by adding interactive "Success" animations to give drivers better feedback when a collection is confirmed. This design ensures that the data sensed by the bins is effectively communicated through a clean and intuitive user interface.
